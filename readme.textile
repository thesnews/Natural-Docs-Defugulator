h2. Install

Drop the 'defug.css' file into your NaturalDocs project directory and call it with the '-s' switch.

After the docs are generated, just drop the rest of the directories from 'styes' into your documentation's 'styles' directory. Don't worry, they'll stay put when you regerate the docs.

The other three items are updates to existing NaturalDocs code that support some of the Defugulators features, but aren't strictly necessary.
